# Squash webserver

Squash is written in Go, using the [Gin framework](https://gin-gonic.com/)

Since Squash is a pretty simple program, Gin is a great candidate to host the web api.

## How to run

For the best experience, I encourage to run this with docker & docker-compose.

```
cd src
docker-compose-up
```
